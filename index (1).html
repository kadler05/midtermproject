    <h2>Background: Source and Spread of the Virus</h2>
    <p>CDC and other health organizations are responding to an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a new
        coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in more than 100 locations
        internationally,
        including in the United States. The virus has been named “SARS-CoV-2” and the disease it causes has been named
        “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”).</p>

    <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals,
        including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread
        between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).</p>

    <p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their
        origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted,
        suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.</p>

    <p>Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link
        to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of
        patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.
        Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in
        the United States. Some international destinations now have apparent community spread with the virus that
        causes COVID-19, as do some parts of the United States. Community spread means some people have been
        infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed.</p>
