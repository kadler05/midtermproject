    <h2>How will cornonavirus affect me and my team?</h2>

    <p>The NCAA president recently made an announcment affecting all DI, DII and DIII sports regarding attendance and

        championships this year.</p>

    <p>As my team, FHSU women's softball enters conference play, I can't help but wonder how conronavirus might affect
        our season. Will our fans be allowed to watch and support us? Will our season get cut short and end prematurely?
